                            <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                            <p>
                                When you log in to <span>Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents
                                your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", "Await feedback"
                                and "Done".
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>

                        <div>
                            <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                            <p>
                                In <span>Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the
                                "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once
                                added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the
                                board.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>

                        <div>
                            <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                            <p>
                                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
                                individual
                                tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
                                task
                                details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                            <p>
                                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by
                                dragging
                                and dropping the card from one list to another.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                            <p>
                                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                                Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution
                                when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.

                                Remember that using <span>Join</span> effectively requires consistent updates from you
                                and
                                your team to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.
